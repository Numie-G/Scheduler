# Scheduler

This project was created as a highschool coding project and was designed for my cousin to use at his clinic. It creates a GUI using JavaFx in which you can input client's names and store some of their information. It included a table to see when the next closest appointment was and could edit appointment dates. It was my first time building a GUI.
